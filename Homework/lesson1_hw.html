        <img src = "assets/elephant.jpg"/> 
        <p>
                The largest land mammal on earth, the African elephant weighs up to eight tons. The elephant is distinguished by its massive body, large ears and a long trunk, which has many uses ranging from using it as a hand to pick up objects, as a horn to trumpet warnings, an arm raised in greeting to a hose for drinking water or bathing.

            <img src = "assets/lion.jpg"/> 
            <p>
                    For all of their roaring, growling, and ferociousness, lions are family animals and truly social in their own communities. They usually live in groups of 15 or more animals called prides.

            <p>
                    The Bear is a well-known animal. It is a big animal with either lighter or darker brown fur. Tail is short and not well seen among its fur. The young have a white collar around their neck, sometimes the adults also still have it. Bears walk like humans do on their soles. It has dull teeth as all these who eat both plants and animals.
